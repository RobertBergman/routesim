# Progress

## What Works
- Memory Bank structure established with core files, context restoration operational.
- Project scaffolded (monorepo: core, backend, frontend).
- Core topology models (`Device`, `NetworkInterface`, `Link`, `TopologyManager`) implemented. Type definitions cleaned up.
- Modular routing engine framework created (`RoutingEngine` interface).
- **Routing Engines:**
    - **OSPF, IS-IS, BGP:** Implemented with simplified, RFC-aligned logic (neighbor discovery, message handling, DB maintenance, route computation).
    - **Static:** Basic implementation for adding/removing routes.
    - **RIP:** Stub implementation only.
- **Backend:**
    - Express server with REST API for managing devices, interfaces, links, and basic protocol enablement.
    - WebSocket server initialized (no active message handling yet).
- **Frontend:**
    - React app with centralized state management (`App.tsx`).
    - UI components (`DevicePanel`, `InterfacePanel`, `LinkPanel`) for adding topology elements. `LinkPanel` uses dropdowns.
    - Basic SVG visualization of topology (`TopologyGraph`).
    - API integration for fetching and adding topology elements (optimistic updates).
    - **Topology Import/Export:** UI buttons and logic in `App.tsx` to import/export topology via JSON files.
    - **Local Storage Persistence:** Topology state is loaded from and saved to browser local storage.

## What's Left to Build
- **Core:**
    - Complete RIP engine implementation.
    - Implement TODOs in `TopologyModels.ts` (`sendPacket`, `getLocalPrefixes`, `updateRoutingTable`).
- **Testing:**
    - **Significantly improve test coverage** for OSPF, IS-IS, BGP engines (correctness, edge cases, interface changes).
    - Add tests for Static engine methods.
    - Add tests for RIP engine once implemented.
- **Backend:**
    - Implement WebSocket message broadcasting for real-time updates.
    - Implement delete operations for topology elements and protocols.
    - Expand API for detailed protocol configuration.
- **Frontend:**
    - Implement WebSocket message handling in `App.tsx` to update state.
    - Add UI elements for deleting topology elements and protocols.
    - Display routing tables and protocol status in `DevicePanel`.
    - Add controls for detailed protocol configuration.
    - Potentially switch `TopologyGraph` to Cytoscape.js or enhance SVG visualization.
- **Documentation:**
    - Expand Memory Bank (feature details, API docs, testing strategy).

## Current Status
- Core simulation models and routing engine framework are in place.
- OSPF, IS-IS, BGP engines are implemented with simplified logic. Static is basic, RIP is a stub.
- Backend provides foundational API for topology management.
- Frontend allows adding devices, interfaces, links, visualizes the topology via SVG, and supports import/export + local storage persistence.
- **Major gap: Test coverage for core routing logic.**
- Ready for WebSocket implementation, RIP completion, testing improvements, and UI enhancements.

## Known Issues
- **Lack of test coverage** for core routing engines is a significant risk.
- RIP protocol not implemented.
- Real-time updates via WebSocket not implemented.
- Delete operations not implemented.
- Detailed protocol configuration not implemented (API or UI).
- Routing table/status not displayed in UI.
- `TopologyGraph` uses basic SVG, not Cytoscape.js as potentially intended earlier.
- Manual Memory Bank updates required.
- Express 5 type quirks require some casting (`as unknown as RequestHandler`).

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Prioritized persistent, file-based memory due to stateless nature.
- Adopted hierarchical, layered context model.
- Emphasized explicit, comprehensive documentation.
- Committed to incremental, transparent updates.
