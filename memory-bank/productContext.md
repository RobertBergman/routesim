# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
Cline is an expert AI software engineer designed to assist with complex development tasks. Due to its stateless nature and memory resets between sessions, a persistent Memory Bank is essential to maintain project continuity, context, and quality.

## Problems It Solves
- Prevents loss of project knowledge across sessions.
- Eliminates redundant onboarding and re-explanation.
- Enables Cline to resume work efficiently with full context.
- Supports consistent adherence to project goals and standards.

## How It Should Work
- At the start of every session, Cline reads all Memory Bank files before any task.
- Memory Bank files provide layered, hierarchical context.
- Cline updates Memory Bank files after significant changes or when explicitly instructed.
- The Memory Bank evolves alongside the project, capturing decisions, progress, and insights.

## User Experience Goals
- Minimize user effort in re-explaining project details.
- Maximize Clineâ€™s effectiveness and precision from the start of each session.
- Ensure transparency of project state and decision history.
- Facilitate smooth collaboration and onboarding of new contributors.
