# Project Brief

## Purpose
Develop a web-based, user-manipulable routing simulator with modular, pluggable routing engines, supported by a persistent, structured Memory Bank and operational rules for Cline, an expert AI software engineer, to ensure continuity and precision across sessions despite memory resets.

## Goals
- Build a flexible network simulation environment supporting enterprise-grade topologies.
- Implement modular routing engines (Static, RIP, OSPF, BGP, IS-IS) that can be attached to devices.
- Enable users to dynamically create, configure, and manipulate devices, interfaces, links, and routing protocols.
- Maintain comprehensive project context through Markdown-based Memory Bank files.
- Enable Cline to fully restore context at the start of every session.
- Document project scope, architecture, technology, progress, and active focus.
- Codify operational rules and workflows for consistent, high-quality output.

## Scope
- Design and implement a modular routing engine framework.
- Develop a dynamic topology management system with hierarchical device/interface/link models.
- Create a user interface and API for topology and routing manipulation.
- Initialize and maintain core Memory Bank files documenting all specifications.
- Define Cline's operational rules in a dedicated document.
- Support ongoing updates to Memory Bank as project evolves.
- Facilitate efficient onboarding for new features or contributors.

## Success Criteria
- All core Memory Bank files created and maintained.
- Cline reliably restores context from Memory Bank on every reset.
- Rules and workflows clearly documented and followed.
- Project knowledge remains accurate, up-to-date, and actionable.
